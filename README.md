# scheme-interpreter
A Scheme interpreter heavily based on the book
"Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours". It has almost the same behaviour as what
the book suggests, except for weak typing in an equality check and `mem` and `assoc` behaviour.

The book focuses only on the functionality of the code and does not guide you
to have a proper project setup, which I tried to do myself.
